# Mullet


## What is it?
Mullet (Multilayer network) is a framework for decoding diverse molecular interactions underlying gene expression data and organizing them into a scalable multilayer network. Furthermore, Mullet enables the identification of signaling modules and key regulators within this network. This system contains two executable programs: ‘Module Detection.jar’ for network construction and module detection and ‘Survival Analysis.jar’ for prognostic regulator identification.


## Software requirements

- Java 1.5 or later must be installed.  [Download link](http://www.java.com)
- 1024 MB Java heap memory minimum.
- Operating systems: Platform independent

## Running

- Once Java is installed, to start Mullet in Microsoft Windows double click on ‘Module Detection.jar’ or ‘Survival Analysis.jar’.  
- Otherwise start Mullet from a command line while in the Mullet directory, enter the command: java -mx1024M -jar Module Detection.jar (or Survival Analysis.jar)
- If Mullet reports ‘Out of Memory Error’, the user can increase the -mx parameter.
- A detailed description can be found in 'User manual.pdf'.
